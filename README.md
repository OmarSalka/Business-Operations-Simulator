## Brief code walk-through
Originally we were provided with statistics that represent the state of an Inspection Station's operations, such as the rate at which vehicles visit the facility and the percentage of vehicles that would need repairs. 
With this information, we were able to simulate the business' operations and managed to measure other data, such as the average delay of queue, average length of queue, utilization, total_arrivals, total_service_charge, and money wasted on idle workers.
After that we studied the results and discovered the points of weakness, (underutilization and bottlenecks and made business recommendations that would solve these problems.
We developed an optimized simulation that included our suggestions which boosted the utilization by 46% and reduced idle costs by 50%.

### How to obtain the results
Each of the two python files (original.py and Optimized.py) return a list of csv files with all the data for every vehicle that enters the facility as well as a matrix that summarizes the data into meaningful statistics. To obtain these basically run the file on your terminal and, voila, you'll see the files in you r working directory!
